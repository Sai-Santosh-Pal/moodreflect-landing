If it's about the app a person would really not like to share his emotion swings with his family or friends but i would love it to have like recorded and written motivational quotes and the journal part is something that holds immense emotions which should not be in any way shared like ur friends will tease u nothing else not as a personal thing cuz i have two loving parents 
I coup with bad days by playing with my friends or just watch something that i know will cheer me up like cute pet videos as I love dogs and cat but other people can like there things"
